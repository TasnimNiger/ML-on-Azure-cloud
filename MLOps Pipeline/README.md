### Azure Pipelines

Azure ML pipelines are a way to define and orchestrate a series of interconnected steps or tasks to automate end-to-end machine learning workflows. These pipelines provide a structured and scalable approach to building, deploying, and managing machine learning workflows using Azure ML abstractions. Here's an explanation of Azure ML pipelines:

1. Components:
   - An Azure ML pipeline consists of multiple steps (called components), each representing a specific task or operation within the workflow.
   - Each step can include activities such as data preparation, feature engineering, model training, model evaluation, deployment, and more.
   - Steps can be connected sequentially, where the output of one step serves as the input for the next step, allowing for a seamless flow of data and execution.

2. Interconnected Workflow:
   Azure ML pipelines enable the creation of a workflow with interconnected steps, allowing for the automatic flow of data and dependencies between the steps.
   - By defining the dependencies between steps, Azure ML ensures that each step is executed in the correct order, respecting the dependencies and data flow.

3. Handoff Automation:
   - Azure ML pipelines automate the handoff between steps by managing the input and output data of each step.
   - The output of one step is automatically passed as input to the subsequent step, eliminating the need for manual intervention or data transfer.
   - This automation simplifies the overall workflow and reduces the risk of errors or inconsistencies in data handoff.

In this notebook, I created a pipeline with three steps: 
- Step 1: Preprocessing
- Step 2: Training
- Step 3: Assemble Pipeline
